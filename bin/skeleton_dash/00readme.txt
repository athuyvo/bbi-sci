The React source file for the skeleton_dash/js/exp.js and skeleton_dash/js/footer.js are in the Github repository

  https://github.com/bbi-lab/RNA_Exp_Dashboard

Edit the source files in RNA_Exp_Dashboard/src and set up npx to compile them and store the compiled versions in RNA_Exp_Dashboard/js. You need to copy the compiled versions to bbi-sci/bin/skeleton_dash/js.
